# Psiphon for Windows

This repository contains the code for the Psiphon for Windows client software.

## AUTOSPEND NOTES

* unrelated(?) bug: psicash UI should be visible pre-connection if it showed before (like, sometimes the UI doesn't show up at all, even though it should be pre-visible)
* persist checkbox
* translate "Automatic"
* add flag indicating autospend to purchase req metadata
* preference for system-idle autospend stop? message indicating why the system-idle stopped? Maybe semi-persistent corner toast?
* Maybe corner-toast for all auto-purchases as well. Yeah.
